# ProofPatcher

> A project for the **Meta Global AI Developer Hackathon 2026** (Indie Developer Track).

ProofPatcher is a local prototype for inspecting GitHub pull requests and testing sample UI repairs. It records PR metadata and existing checks and can show a read-only preview of changes from a public PR at the captured commits. Its visual verifier currently runs on bundled checkout fixtures, not on the selected PR. A worktree is not a security sandbox for untrusted code.

## Quickstart

### 1. Requirements
* PHP 8.4+ with `ext-gd` and `ext-json`
* Composer
* Node.js 20+ and npm
* Chrome / Chromium (for headless browser verification)

### 2. Setup
For a new installation, install dependencies, create a private application key, build frontend assets, and prepare the local SQLite database. Keep the generated `.env` private and do not regenerate the key for an existing installation:

```bash
composer install
npm install && npm run build
cp .env.example .env
php artisan key:generate
php artisan migrate
```

### 3. Run the Web Dashboard
Start the local server using standard Laravel Artisan:

```bash
php artisan serve
```

Open **http://127.0.0.1:8000** in your browser.

*(Alternatively, run `php artisan serve --port=8431`).*

For an existing installation, back up the SQLite database before running `php artisan migrate`. The task-card migration adds a table; rolling it back deletes the cards in that table.

### Issue suggestions

The Issues page also lets a connected user save text task cards for repositories granted to the GitHub app. Cards stay local and are not assigned to Muse or run automatically.

The Issues page can load issues from repositories granted to the connected GitHub account. A public issue and selected text file can also be previewed when that repository is granted. Muse suggestions are unverified until checked. The dedicated test workflow requires a local repository and revision allowlist; it is disabled when those settings are absent. General automatic reviews, GitHub comment triggers, and verification of arbitrary model-generated patches are not yet supported.

To enable the dedicated test workflow, set `PROOFPATCH_TEST_REPO` to the exact `owner/repository` and `PROOFPATCH_TEST_BASE_COMMIT` to the intended 40-character commit SHA in your private environment. The workflow is limited to the bundled test case and pinned file hashes. Do not commit private settings.

## CLI Usage

### Inspect a GitHub Pull Request
Fetch pull request metadata, changed files, and check runs, saving a local snapshot with a digest. The digest is not an independent authenticity guarantee. You can use shorthand handles, full URLs, or run interactively:

```bash
# Shorthand handle
php artisan review:inspect owner/repo#123

# Full URL
php artisan review:inspect https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/123

# Interactive prompt
php artisan review:inspect
```

### Record an Existing Local Snapshot
Record a saved snapshot in SQLite for review:

```bash
php artisan review:record <SNAPSHOT_ID>
```

### Inspect a Review via HTTP API
Query review status, repository metadata, and the saved snapshot digest:

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/reviews/<REVIEW_ID>
```

## Testing

Run the full PHPUnit test suite:

```bash
php artisan test
# or
./vendor/bin/phpunit
```

Run browser driver detection (if needed):

```bash
composer drivers
```
